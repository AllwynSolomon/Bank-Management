The system should be highly secure, with measures in place to prevent unauthorized access, protect customer data, and prevent fraudulent transactions. It should also be scalable, able to handle a large volume of transactions and users without compromising performance.

In addition, the system should be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows customers to perform transactions easily and quickly. It should also be easy to maintain, with clear and organized code that can be updated or modified as needed.
